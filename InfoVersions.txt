v5.0:

- Implemented Monsteins comments to make it all more customizable
- Added new version of runProgram.sh (runProgram_v2.sh) which executes ./hackrf_sweep with input parameters read from "config.cfg"
- runProgram_v2.sh not execute generationFits.py to minimize times. So it is executed from another script call "generationPython.sh"
- Implementation of "generationPython.sh" to separate functionalities. It will only execute if generationMode is with Python
