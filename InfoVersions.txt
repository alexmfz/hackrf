- Questions:
    - Is it a timer question?       No. It has been tested and the timer set variables correctly
    - Is the timer good defined?        Yes
    - Is the reconfiguration the problem because of the time?      No, it is aroung 0.05 s
    - Is the loop the problem because of the time?      No sense, timer activates after call of hackRFTrigger()
    - Is it a hardware question?        ??
    - Can it be execute the original code with bash file?       No, it gives some null outputs or sweep incompleted
